# The smuggler's dilemma
The smuggler's dilemma is a term that describes the difficulty we face when deciding whether learning a new topic or skill is the best option at a given time. This is because, especially in the field of technology, there is a great deal of information that we do not yet know, and the amount of information available online can be overwhelming.

FOMO (fear of missing out) and imposter syndrome are two of the emotions that can arise when facing the smuggler's dilemma. FOMO can make us feel like we're missing out on important opportunities if we don't learn something new, while imposter syndrome can make us feel like we're not good enough to learn a new topic or skill.

The smuggler's dilemma is not about deciding whether or not we should learn something new, but about questioning our motives and understanding if this is the best time to do so. Some useful questions we can ask ourselves when facing the smuggler's dilemma include:

- Why do I want to learn this?
- Is this a skill or knowledge that I need right now for my current work or projects?
- Do I have enough time and energy to learn this properly right now?
- Am I willing to invest the time and energy required to learn this?
By answering these questions, we can make a more informed decision about whether learning a new topic or skill is the best option at a given time. Ultimately, the smuggler's dilemma is about finding a balance between the need to learn new things and the ability to do so effectively and meaningfully.

## Proposal

It's true that we will always have a list of things to learn, whether it's from our career, courses, recommendations from others, or our own curiosity. This list can be overwhelming, especially when we don't know where to start or how to prioritize our learning.

The smuggler's dilemma offers a solution to the problem by teaching us to differentiate valuable learning from those that are not. Instead of simply determining whether we should learn something or not, it is important to evaluate the relevance and necessity of each topic on our learning list.

It's important to understand that the anxiety we often feel comes from external sources, such as the fear of missing out or social pressure to always be up-to-date. We must learn to value valuable learning, those that will allow us to move forward in our career or projects significantly, and set aside those that are not as relevant.

However, this doesn't mean we should completely dismiss non-essential learning. Instead, we can use it as an opportunity to learn in a relaxed and fun way. This can help us reduce anxiety and enjoy the learning process more.

Ultimately, the smuggler's dilemma is a problem of criteria, and learning to critically evaluate our learning list can help us make more informed and meaningful decisions about what we really need to learn.
